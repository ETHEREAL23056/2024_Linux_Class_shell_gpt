This is my team's shell_gpt on 2024 Linux Class  
Fork from https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt  
Add some small functions to let it work better  
1. To list all exist dialogs and choose or create one  
```Shell
sgpt --repl -ls
```
2. To Search keyword for dialog
```Shell
sgpt --repl -sa
```
4. To delete needless dialogs
```Shell
sgpt --repl -dl
```
